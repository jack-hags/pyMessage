# pyMessage
Send song lyrics to iMessage users using the Genius lyrics API.

## Setup
1.) Open the **main.py** file, and add your API key on *line 7*.
2.) Install the required packages:
    a.) lyricsgenius
    b.) 
3.) Run the script by typing ``` 
python3 main.py```
4.) Follow the prompts in terminal to begin spamming. (The first is a song, the second is the phone number.)

## Important
**In order for the messages to send, you must allow terminal "full disk access" on Mac for this to work.
To do so, go to:**
```System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Privacy -> Full Disk Access -> Click "Terminal"```
